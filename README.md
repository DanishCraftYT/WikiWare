# WikiWare
a simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript framework for making basic wikies that look like Wikipedia.<br>

# TODO
* test images to make sure they are compatible with the framework.<br>
* consider adding a "wiki-headersubsection" for grouping multiple header items together.<br>
* consider making a custom "details" element which works like the one from fandom wikies.<br>
* a info box similar to "wiki-tablecontent".<br>
