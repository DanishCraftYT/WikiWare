# WikiWare
a simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript framework for making basic wikies that look like Wikipedia.<br>

# TODO
* consider adding a "wiki-headersubsection" for grouping multiple header items together.<br>
* consider making a custom "subdetails" element which works like the one from fandom wikies.<br>
* add a "wiki-boxsection" element which draws a border around the section instead of creating a line at the bottom of it.<br>
